{% newthought "About two months ago" %}, if my browser history is to be trusted, I read an article linked on Hacker News called [Don't End the Week with Nothing (2014)](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing). To say that it suck with me is an understatement. After all, this blog is my reaction to the ailment that Patrick, the creator of that post, so aptly diagnosed.

I don't own my work.

I can't point to the private repos at work.

I simply do not have access to the capital -- human, social, or reputational{% sidenote "capital-definitions" "As defined by the article, human capital are the skills you build up, social capital are the relationships you can rely on, and repuational capital is how much weight your name carries."} -- I create for my company. While I likely never will (Government contracts are **not** what you want if you desire visability), my goal from now on will be to end the week with *something*. I've worked on various side projects in the past -- DIY speakers, a NAS to store media and run plex, hackathons, an arduino-powerd sous-vide using a rice-cooker -- but never exposed them publically. This site's purpose is to change that, and to allow others to benefit from my write-ups, or even from my ramblings like this one.
