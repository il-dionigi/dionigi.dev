{% newthought 'Ciao!' %}

My name is Brian Raymond, but I usually go by my middle name -- Dionigi -- when online. Offline, I'm a newly-graduated software engineer with an interest in flight software and other software running on embedded platforms. Here are the things I enjoy besides coding in no particular order: podcasts (Freakonomics Radio, Today Explained, Code Switch, Planet Money, Ezra Klein, Radio Lab, among others), powerlifting, italian rap, manga (too many to list, and I don't want to out myself), news (Economist's Espresso, Hacker News), cooking, and movies.

{% newthought "This site's purpose" %} is to encourage me to end each week with *something* that has outward visibility. For the time being, posts will be made here sporadically, either when I finish with a project (could be a short as a day, to even weeks!) or want to write something down.

In addition, I find that we don't get nearly enough practice writing sentences and trying to articulate our thoughts as software engineers. The *crux* of programming is often seen as logic and mathematics; however, lots of programming responsibilities, like documentation or pull-requests, rely on writing and communication skills. My goal through posts on here is also to practise my communication skills, and (hopefully) ensure I remember how to keep sentences interesting. :)
