This page contains a list of the projects and thoughts that I either want to pursue or am actively pursuing. I'm guessing the distribution between the different types will be 40% hardware, 40% software, and 20% thoughts, but we'll see{% sidenote "sidenote-type-distribution" "Really, it'll depend on whether or not I make posts for more of my purely hardware projects like DIY speaker builds or NAS upgrades." %}.

Statuses can be whatever I want them to be :)
